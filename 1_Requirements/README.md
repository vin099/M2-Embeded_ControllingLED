# Introduction
  LED is a semiconductor device used in many electronic devices, mostly used for indication purposes. It is used widely as indicator during test for checking the validity of results at different stages.

It is very cheap and easily available in variety of shape, color and size. The LEDs are also used in designing of message display boards and traffic control signal lights etc.
# Objective
   The main objective is to control the led using ATmega328.
# Components used
1.ATmega328   

2.Two LED 

3.Controller

4.Resistor
# software used
1.simulIDe

2.Visual Studie Code


# Features
   It has simple features.
       
    1.It can switch off the LED's when controller is in off state.
    2.It can switch on the LED's when controller is in on state.
# 4W's and 1 H's
   ## Why
    1.To blink two LED's using a switch in ATmega328.
    2.To understand basic concepts in ATmega328.
